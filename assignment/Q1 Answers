My findings did not surprise me as I knew a lot about the careers that I had wanted to pursue through events like career fairs and from speaking with people who already work in the field. 
I ranked the software developer first because it has the highest average annual salary while only requring a Bachelor's degree and I have gained a lot of hands-on practice through coursework and internships.
I ranked the rest based on my preferences and how much experience I have gained so far in relation to the focal points of each occupation. 
For example, I am not as familiar with computer networks and how to create them, but I did take a few courses related to the subject so that is why I decided to research it more for this job search question.
